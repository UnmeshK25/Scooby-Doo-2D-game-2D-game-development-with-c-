# Scooby-Doo 2D game: 2D game development with c++
The data driven animation project of game development with artifitial intelligence includes the implementation of singleton, factory, flyweight design patterns through different classes in tracker framework. The tracker framework includes XML parser, the data changes in XML reflects the changes in animation through framework. The project includes the development and implementation of collision detection and explosion on collision detection. Implementation of shooting of bullets by player who is controlling based on 'a','s','d','w' keyboard keys. This project also includes the implementation of artifitial intelligence.
